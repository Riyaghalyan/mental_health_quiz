      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Feeling sad or down is a normal part of life. We all experience it from time to time, whether it's due to a breakup, a job loss, or just a bad day. But when these feelings persist for weeks or months and start to interfere with our daily lives, it may be a sign of depression.</p>
      <h2>Depression</h2>
      <p>Depression is a mental health disorder characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and worthlessness. It can also cause physical symptoms like fatigue, insomnia, and changes in appetite. Depression is a serious condition that requires treatment, such as therapy or medication. If you think you may be experiencing depression, it's important to talk to a healthcare professional.</p>

      <h2>Normal Sadness</h2>
      <p>Normal sadness, on the other hand, is a natural response to life's ups and downs. It may be triggered by a specific event, such as a loss or a disappointment, and usually resolves on its own within a few days or weeks. While it can be unpleasant, it doesn't typically interfere with our ability to function or enjoy life. It's important to take care of ourselves during these periods by getting enough rest, eating well, and engaging in activities we enjoy.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>While sadness is a normal part of life, it's important to know when it may be a sign of something more serious, like depression. If you're feeling down for an extended period of time and it's impacting your daily life, don't hesitate to seek help from a healthcare professional. Remember, it's okay to not be okay.<br><br> <h2>let's take a test to differentiate the feeling :)</h2> </p>
